How to build?
=============
This project use GNU Autotools as build system, so it's quite simple to build it
like below:

$ autoreconf -i (if you're using git tree source)
$ ./configure CFLAGS="-m32 -O2"
$ make

By default, autoconf will add "-g -O2" to CFLAGS, so it's a good idea to
overwrite it by the above to strip the output binary size.

For more advanced usage, please refer to INSTALL.


How to install?
===============
This project will generates two binaries: tboot, osip_reader. And will be
installed into $prefix/bin by "make install".

However, this project assuming be used in Pre-OS runtime only, so just make sure
"src/tboot" installed in Pre-OS runtime PATH will be OK.
